ABOUT THE APP

A browser-based machine learning application where the user can train a ChatterBot-based chatbot 
(https://pypi.org/project/ChatterBot/) using prompts, files, and artificial intelligence. In this example, the bot is trained to answer only historical questions. The backend of the application is built with Python's FastApi framework, and the user interface is built with Vanilla JavaScript and HTML.
